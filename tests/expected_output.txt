# Expected Output for Memory Management Simulator Tests

TEST CASE 1: Initialize Memory and Basic Allocation
Memory initialized with size 1024
Allocator changed
Allocated block id=1 at address=0x0
Allocated block id=2 at address=0x64
----- Memory Stats -----
Total memory: 1024
Used memory: 300
Free memory: 724
Memory utilization: 29.2969%
External fragmentation: 0%


TEST CASE 2: Free Memory and Coalescing
Memory initialized with size 1024
Allocated block id=1 at address=0x0
Allocated block id=2 at address=0x64
Allocated block id=3 at address=0xc8
Block 2 freed
----- Memory Dump -----
[0x0 - 0x63] USED (id=1)
[0x64 - 0xc7] FREE
[0xc8 - 0x13b] USED (id=3)

TEST CASE 5: Cache Operations
Cache initialized (L1=5, L2=10)
Inserted address 100 with value 42
Cache HIT, value = 42
L1 MISS -> L2 MISS -> MEMORY ACCESS
----- Cache Statistics -----
L1 Hits: 2 | L1 Misses: 1
L2 Hits: 0 | L2 Misses: 1
Main Memory Accesses: 1
